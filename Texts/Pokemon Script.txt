Citation of objects in speaker identification denotes that the proceeding text
is that of the message displayed upon examination of the objects in question.


   * - Text
Descriptions of character actions, et cetera.


   -(Text)
Following the above would be the events prompted by a particular option.
The number of hyphens corresponds to the choice layer; i.e., the first set
of options will have one hyphen, the second set will have two, and so on.
One equal sign accounts for two hyphens.

* - An image of a man in a lab coat appears.

Oak       : Hello there! Welcome to the world of POKEMON! My name is OAK!
            People call me the POKEMON PROF!

* - An image of a Nidorino appears.

Oak       : This world is inhabited by creatures called POKEMON! For some
            people, POKEMON are pets. Others use them for fights. Myself...
            I study POKEMON as a profession.

* - An image of a boy (the player's character) appears.

Oak       : First, what is your name?

* - The first option is that of the version which one is playing.

Oak       : Right! So your name is RED!

* - An image of another boy appears.

Oak       : This is my grandson. He's been your rival since you were a baby.

            ...Erm, what is his name again?

* - The first option is that of the version which one is not playing.

Oak       : That's right! I remember now! His name is BLUE!

* - Red's image reappears.

Oak       : RED! Your very own POKEMON legend is about to unfold! A world of
            dreams and adventures with POKEMON awaits! Let's go!

Mother    : Right. All boys leave home some day. It said so on TV.
            PROF.OAK, next door, is looking for you.

* - When trying to leave town via the grassy path to the north:

Oak       : Hey! Wait! Don't go out!

* - Oak approaches Red.

Oak       : It's unsafe! Wild POKEMON live in tall grass! You need your own
            POKEMON for your protection. I know! Here, come with me!

* - He takes Red to his laboratory. They approach a table upon which three
    Poke Balls have been placed, and next to which Blue is present.

Blue      : Gramps! I'm fed up with waiting!

Oak       : BLUE? Let me think... Oh, that's right, I told you to come!
            Just wait!

            Here, RED! There are 3 POKEMON here! Haha! They are inside the
            POKE BALLS. When I was young, I was a serious POKEMON trainer.
            In my old age, I have only 3 left, but you can have one! Choose!

Blue      : Hey! Gramps! What about me?

Oak       : Be patient! BLUE, you can have one too!



* - Before selecting a Pokemon:

Oak       : Now, RED, which POKEMON do you want?

Blue      : Heh, I don't need to be greedy like you! Go ahead and choose, RED!

* - Upon attempting to leave:

Oak       : Hey! Don't go away yet!



* - The three available Pokemon are Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle.

    After viewing the description of a given Pokemon:

Oak       : So! You want the <plant/fire/water> POKEMON, <NAME>?

* - If "NO" is selected, then nothing more is said and a new choice is made.
    If "YES" is selected:

Oak       : This POKEMON is really energetic!

* - Red takes the Pokemon.

Blue      : I'll take this one, then!

* - Blue chooses whichever Pokemon has a type advantage over Red's selection.



* - Before leaving:

Oak       : If a wild POKEMON appears, your POKEMON can fight against it!

Blue      : My POKEMON looks a lot stronger.

3rd Ball  : That's PROF.OAK's last POKEMON!



* - Upon attempting to leave:

Blue      : Wait RED! Let's check out our POKEMON! Come on, I'll take you on!


* - At the battle's end, if Blue won:

Blue      : Yeah! Am I great or what?

* - If he lost:

Blue      : WHAT? Unbelievable! I picked the wrong POKEMON!


* - Regardless:

Blue      : Okay! I'll make my POKEMON fight to toughen it up!

            RED! Gramps! Smell you later!

* - He takes his leave of the laboratory, as well as the town.

            The battle moves of POKEMON are limited by their POWER POINTs, PP.
            To replenish PP, rest your tired POKEMON at a POKEMON CENTER!

[001]     : Those POKE BALLS at your waist! You have POKEMON! It's great that
            you can carry and use POKEMON any time, anywhere!

[002]     : You want to know about the 2 kinds of caterpillar POKEMON?

            -----------------------------------------------
                 -(YES)
            CATERPIE has no poison, but WEEDLE does. Watch out for its
            POISON STING!

    is standing next to him.

[003]     : Oh Grandpa! Don't be so mean!

            He hasn't had his coffee yet.

[004]     : You can't go through here! This is private property!

[005]     : Yawn! I must have dozed off in the sun. I had this dream about
            a DROWZEE eating my dream. What's this? Where did this TM come from?
            This is spooky! Here, you can have this TM.

              * - If the inventory is full:
            You have too much stuff already.

              * - If there is room, he provides TM42.

[004]     : This shop sells many ANTIDOTEs.

[005]     : No! POTIONs are all sold out!

[006]     : Whew! I'm trying to memorize all my notes.

Notebook  : Looked at the notebook! First page... POKE BALLS are used to catch
            POKEMON. Up to 6 POKEMON can be carried. People who raise and make
            POKEMON fight are called POKEMON trainers.

            Second page... A healthy POKEMON may be hard to catch, so weaken it
            first! Poison, burns and other damage are effective!

            Third page... POKEMON trainers seek others to engage in POKEMON
            fights. Battles are constantly fought at POKEMON GYMs.

            Fourth page... The goal for POKEMON trainers is to beat the top
            8 POKEMON GYM LEADERs. Do so to earn the right to face...
            The ELITE FOUR of POKEMON LEAGUE!

[006]     : Hey! Don't look at my notes!


[007]     : Okay! Be sure to read the blackboard carefully!

Blackboard: The blackboard describes POKEMON STATUS changes during battles.
            Which heading do you want to read?

            -----------------------------------------------
                 -(SLP)
            A POKEMON can't attack if it's asleep! POKEMON will stay asleep
            even after battles. Use AWAKENING to wake them up!



                 -(BRN)
            A burn reduces power and speed. It also causes ongoing damage.
            Burns remain after battles. Use BURN HEAL to cure a burn!



                 -(PSN)
            When poisoned, a POKEMON's health steadily drops. Poison lingers
            after battles. Use an ANTIDOTE to cure poison!



                 -(FRZ)
            If frozen, a POKEMON becomes totally immobile! It stays frozen
            even after the battle ends. Use ICE HEAL to thaw out POKEMON!



                 -(PAR)
            Paralysis could make POKEMON moves misfire! Paralysis remains after
            battles. Use PARLYZ HEAL for treatment!

            I see you're using a POKEDEX. When you catch a POKEMON, POKEDEX is

[001]     : You're making an encyclopedia on POKEMON? That sounds amusing.

[002]     : I want a bright red BICYCLE! I'll keep it at home, so it won't
            get dirty!

<game>    : SLOWBRO took a snooze...
[003]     : SLOWBRO, WITHDRAW! No! That's wrong! It's so hard to control
            POKEMON! Your POKEMON's obedience depends on your abilities as
            a trainer!

[004]     : You're a trainer too? Collecting, fighting, it's a tough life.

[005]     : That bush in front of the shop is in the way. There might be a
            way around.

* - [006], a police officer, is blocking the way into a house.

[006]     : The people here were robbed. It's obvious that TEAM ROCKET is
            behind this most heinous crime! Even our POLICE force has trouble
            with the ROCKETs!

[007]     : This is CERULEAN CAVE! Horribly strong POKEMON live in there!
            The POKEMON LEAGUE champion is the only person who is allowed in!

* - After the events of section 02'40, [007] leaves his post.

* - Pokemon Center:

[001]     : BILL has lots of POKEMON! He collects rare ones too!

[002]     : Have you heard about BILL? Everyone calls him a POKEMANIAC! I think
            people are just jealous of BILL, though. Who wouldn't want to boast
            about their POKEMON?

[003]     : That BILL! I heard that he'll do whatever it takes to get rare
            POKEMON!

[004]     : Use REPEL to keep bugs and weak POKEMON away. Put your strongest
            POKEMON at the top of the list for best results!

[005]     : Have you seen any RARE CANDY? It's supposed to make POKEMON go up
            one level!

Bicycle   : A shiny new BICYCLE!

[006]     : Hi! Welcome to our BIKE SHOP. Have we got just the BIKE for you!
            It's a cool BIKE! Do you want it?

              * - It costs P1,000,000.

            Sorry! You can't afford it! Come back again some time!



              * - After acquiring the Bike Voucher from Vermilion City:

            Oh, that's... A BIKE VOUCHER! OK! Here you go!

              * - If the inventory is full:
            You better make room for this!

              * - If there is room, then he provides the Bicycle.

            How do you like your new BICYCLE? You can take it on CYCLING ROAD
            and in caves!

[007]     : A plain city BIKE is good enough for me! You can't put a shopping
            basket on an MTB!

[008]     : These BIKEs are cool, but they're way expensive!

            -----------------------------------------------

            The ATTACK of all POKEMON increases a little bit. It also lets you

                 -(CASCADEBADGE)
            POKEMON up to L30 will obey you. Any higher, they become unruly!
            It also lets you use CUT outside of battle.



                 -(THUNDERBADGE)
            The SPEED of all POKEMON increases a little bit. It also lets you

            LEADER: MISTY
            The Tomboyish Mermaid!

Plaque    : WINNING TRAINERS:
            BLUE

[001]     : Yo! Champ in making! Here's my advice! The LEADER, MISTY, is a pro
            who uses water POKEMON! You can drain all their water with plant
            POKEMON! Or, zap them with electricity!

Trainer 01:{S} Splash! I'm first up! Let's do it!
           {C} SWIMMER
           {E} That can't be!
           {A} MISTY is going to keep improving! She won't lose to someone
               like you!

Trainer 02:{S} I'm more than good enough for you! MISTY can wait!
           {C} JR.TRAINER  (Female)
           {E} You overwhelmed me!
           {A} You have to face other trainers to find out how good you really
               are.

Misty     :{S} Hi, you're a new face! Trainers who want to turn pro have to
               have a policy about POKEMON! What is your approach when you
               catch POKEMON? My policy is an all-out offensive with water-type
               POKEMON!

           {E} Wow! You're too much! All right! You can have the CASCADEBADGE
               to show you beat me!

               The CASCADEBADGE makes all POKEMON up to L30 obey! That includes
               even outsiders! There's more, you can now use CUT any time!
               You can CUT down small bushes to open new paths! You can also
               have my favorite TM!

                 * - If the inventory is full:
               You better make room for this!

                 * - If there is room, she provides TM11.

           {A} TM11 teaches BUBBLEBEAM! Use it on an aquatic POKEMON!

[001]     : You beat MISTY! What'd I tell ya? You and me kid, we make a pretty
            darn good team!

* - Following Red's victory over Misty, the police officer moves out of the way.
    Inside, footprints lead to a large hole in the northern wall.

[012]     : TEAM ROCKET must be trying to DIG their way into no good!

[013]     : Those miserable ROCKETs! Look what they did here! They stole a TM
            for teaching POKEMON how to DIG holes! That cost me a bundle,
            it did!

* - A Team Rocket member is behind the house.

Trainer 01:{S} Hey! Stay out! It's not your yard! Huh? Me? I'm an innocent
               bystander! Don't you believe me?
           {C} ROCKET
           {E} Stop! I give up! I'll leave quietly!
           {A} OK! I'll return the TM I stole!

                 * - If the inventory is full:
               Make room for this! I can't run until I give it to you!

                 * - If there is room, then he provides TM28.
               I better get moving! Bye!

* - After his departure:

[013]     : I figure what's lost is lost! I decided to teach DIGLETT how to DIG
            without a TM!



* - With access to the rear of the house, the path to Route 5 is opened.


#$#$#$#$#$#$#$#$#$

* - Blue appears.

Blue      :{S} Yo! RED! You're still struggling along back here? I'm doing
               great! I caught a bunch of strong and smart POKEMON! Here,
               let me see what you caught, RED!

           {E} Hey! Take it easy! You won already!

               Hey, guess what? I went to BILL's and got him to show me his rare
               POKEMON! That added a lot of pages to my POKEDEX! After all,
               BILL's world famous as a POKEMANIAC! He invented the POKEMON
               Storage System on PC! Since you're using his system, go thank
               him! Well, I better get rolling! Smell ya later!

* - The direction from which Blue came leads to Route 24.

            All POKEMON fans welcome!

[001]     : Did you see the S.S.ANNE moored in the harbor?

[002]     : We're careful about pollution! We've heard GRIMER multiplies in
            toxic sludge!

[003]     : I'm putting up a building on this plot of land. My POKEMON is
            tamping the land.

[001]     : It is true that a higher level POKEMON will be more powerful...
            But, all POKEMON will have weak points against specific types.
            So, there is no universally strong POKEMON.

[002]     : My POKEMON was poisoned! It fainted while we were walking!

[003]     : Even if they are the same level, POKEMON can have very different
            abilities. A POKEMON raised by a trainer is stronger than one in
            the wild.

* - Pokemon Mart:

[004]     : There are evil people who will use POKEMON for criminal acts.
            TEAM ROCKET traffics in rare POKEMON. They also abandon POKEMON
            that they consider not to be popular or useful.

[005]     : I think POKEMON can be good or evil. It depends on the trainer.

Signpost  : SAFFRON CITY POKEMON GYM
            LEADER: SABRINA
            The Master of Psychic POKEMON!

Plaque    : WINNING TRAINERS:
            BLUE

[001]     : Yo! Champ in making! SABRINA's POKEMON use psychic power instead of
            force! Fighting POKEMON are weak against psychic POKEMON! They get
            creamed before they can even aim a punch!

Trainer 01:{S} SABRINA is young, but she's also our LEADER! You won't reach her
               easily!
           {C} PSYCHIC
           {E} I lost my concentration!
           {A} There used to be 2 POKEMON GYMs in SAFFRON. The FIGHTING DOJO
               next door lost its GYM status when we went and creamed them!

Trainer 02:{S} You know that power alone isn't enough!
           {C} PSYCHIC
           {E} I don't believe this!
           {A} SABRINA just wiped out the KARATE MASTER next door!

Trainer 03:{S} Does our unseen power scare you?
           {C} PSYCHIC
           {E} I never foresaw this!
           {A} Psychic POKEMON fear only ghosts and bugs!

Trainer 04:{S} SABRINA is younger than I, but I respect her!
           {C} CHANNELER
           {E} Not good enough!
           {A} In a battle of equals, the one with the stronger will wins!
               If you wish to beat SABRINA, focus on winning!

Trainer 05:{S} SAFFRON POKEMON GYM is famous for its psychics! You want to see
               SABRINA! I can tell!
           {C} PSYCHIC
           {E} Arrrgh!
           {A} That's right! I used telepathy to read your mind!

Trainer 06:{S} POKEMON take on the appearance of their trainers. Your POKEMON
               must be tough, then!
           {C} CHANNELER
           {E} I knew it!
           {A} I must teach better techniques to my POKEMON!

Trainer 07:{S} You and I, our POKEMON shall fight!
           {C} CHANNELER
           {E} I lost after all!
           {A} I knew that this was going to take place.

Sabrina   :{S} I had a vision of your arrival! I have had psychic powers since I
               was a child. I first learned to bend spoons with my mind.
               I dislike fighting, but if you wish, I will show you my powers!

           {E} I'm shocked! But, a loss is a loss. I admit I didn't work hard
               enough to win! You earned the MARSHBADGE!

               The MARSHBADGE makes POKEMON up to L70 obey you! Stronger POKEMON
               will become wild, ignoring your orders in battle! Just don't
               raise your POKEMON too much! Wait, please take this TM with you!

                 * - If the inventory is full:
               Your pack is full of other items!

                 * - If there is room, then she provides TM46.
               TM46 is PSYWAVE! It uses powerful psychic waves to inflict
               damage!

           {A} Everyone has psychic power! People just don't realize it!

[001]     : Psychic power, huh? If I had that, I'd make a bundle at the slots!

Trainer 01:{S} Let's go, but don't cheat!
           {C} YOUNGSTER
           {E} Huh? That's not right!
           {A} I did my best! I have no regrets!

Trainer 02:{S} Win, lose or draw!
           {C} GAMBLER
           {E} Atcha! Didn't go my way!
           {A} POKEMON is life! And to live is to gamble!

Trainer 03:{S} I just became a trainer! But, I think I can win!
           {C} YOUNGSTER
           {E} My POKEMON couldn't!
           {A} What do you want? Leave me alone!

Trainer 04:{S} My POKEMON should be ready by now!
           {C} YOUNGSTER
           {E} Too much, too young!
           {A} I better go find stronger ones!

Trainer 05:{S} Competition! I can't get enough!
           {C} GAMBLER
           {E} I had a chance!
           {A} You can't be a coward in the world of POKEMON!

Trainer 06:{S} I have never won before...
           {C} GAMBLER
           {E} I saw this coming...
           {A} It's just luck. Luck of the draw.

Trainer 07:{S} Careful! I'm laying down some cables!
           {C} ENGINEER
           {E} That was electric!
           {A} Spread the word to save energy!

Trainer 08:{S} Watch out for live wires!
           {C} ENGINEER
           {E} Whoa! You spark plug!
           {A} Well, better get back to work.

Trainer 09:{S} Fwahaha! I have never lost!
           {C} GAMBLER
           {E} My first loss!
           {A} Luck of the draw! Just luck!

Trainer 10:{S} I'm the best in my class!
           {C} YOUNGSTER
           {E} Darn! I need to make my POKEMON stronger!
           {A} There's a fat POKEMON that comes down from the mountains.
               It's strong if you can get it.



[001]     : When you catch lots of POKEMON, isn't it hard to think up names?
            In LAVENDER TOWN, there's a man who rates POKEMON nicknames.
            He'll help you rename them too!

[002]     : Hi! Remember me? I'm PROF.OAK's AIDE! If you caught 30 kinds of
            POKEMON, I'm supposed to give you an ITEMFINDER! So, RED! Have you
            caught at least 30 kinds of POKEMON?

            -----------------------------------------------
                 -(YES)
              * - With less than thirty:
            Let's see... Uh-oh! You have caught only <##> kinds of POKEMON!
            You need 30 kinds if you want the ITEMFINDER.



              * - With thirty or more:
            Great! You have caught <##> kinds of POKEMON! Congratulations!
            Here you go! 

              * - If the inventory is full:
            Oh! I see you don't have any room for the ITEMFINDER.

              * - if there is room, then he provides the ItemFinder.
            There are items on the ground that can't be seen.
            ITEMFINDER will detect an item close to you. It can't pinpoint it,
            so you have to look yourself!



                 -(NO)
            Oh. I see. When you get 30 kinds, come back for ITEMFINDER.
            -----------------------------------------------

[003]     : I'm looking for NIDORINO! Wanna trade one for NIDORINA?

            -----------------------------------------------
                 -(YES)
              * - Upon presenting a different Pokemon:
            What? That's not NIDORINO! If you get come, come back here!


              * - Upon presenting a Nidorino:
            Okay, connect the cable like so!
              * - He provides his Pokemon, nicknamed Terry.
            Hey thanks!

              * - When speaking to him again:
            Isn't my old NIDORINA great?



                 -(NO)
            Awww! Oh well...

* - This route can be accessed from Route 11, or from Lavender Town.
    Fuji's Poke Flute can be used to wake the Snorlax that blocks the road.

<game>    : A sleeping POKEMON blocks the way!
            RED played the POKE FLUTE.
            SNORLAX woke up!
            It attacked in a grumpy rage!

* - If Snorlax's HP is fully depleted:

<game>    : SNORLAX calmed down! With a big yawn, it returned to the mountains!



* - Building:

[001]     : There's a lookout spot upstairs.

[002]     : My POKEMON's ashes are stored in POKEMON TOWER. You can have this
            TM. I don't need it any more...

              * - If the inventory is full:
            You don't have room for this.

              * - If there is room, then she provides TM39.
            TM39 is a move called SWIFT. It's very accurate, so use it during
            battles you can't afford to lose.



Trainer 01:{S} Yeah! I got a bite, here!
           {C} FISHERMAN
           {E} Tch! Just a small fry!

           {E} Too much!
           {A} You beat me at POKEMON, but I'm good at fishing!

Trainer 04:{S} I'd rather be working!
           {C} FISHERMAN
           {E} It's not easy...
           {A} It's all right. Losing doesn't bud me any more.

Trainer 05:{S} Electricity is my specialty!
           {C} ROCKER
           {E} Unplugged!
           {A} Water conducts electricity, so you should zap sea POKEMON!

[003]     : I'm the FISHING GURU's brother! I simply Looove fishing!
            Do you like to fish!

            -----------------------------------------------
                -(YES)
              * - If the inventory is full:
            Oh no! I had a gift for you, but you have no room for it!



              * - If there is room:
            Grand! I like your style! Take this and fish, young one!

              * - He provides the Super Rod.

            Fishing is a way of life! From the seas to rivers, go out and
            land the big one!

              * - When speaking to him again:

            Hello there, RED! Use the SUPER ROD in any water! You can catch
            different kinds of POKEMON. Try fishing wherever you can!



                 -(NO)
            Oh... That's so disappointing...
            -----------------------------------------------

Trainer 06:{S} You never know what you could catch!
           {C} FISHERMAN
           {E} Lost it!
           {A} I catch MAGIKARP all the time, but they're so weak!

Trainer 07:{S} Have you found a MOON STONE?
           {C} JR.TRAINER  (Male)
           {E} Oww!
           {A} I could have made my POKEMON evolve with MOON STONE!

           {A} Did you know that moves like EARTHQUAKE don't have any effect
               on birds?

Trainer 09:{S} When I whistle, I can summon bird POKEMON!

[001]     : Are you working on a POKEDEX? PROF.OAK's AIDE came by here.

[002]     : Hi! Remember me? I'm PROF.OAK's AIDE! If you caught 50 kinds of
            POKEMON, I'm supposed to give you an EXP.ALL! So, RED! Have you
            caught at least 50 kinds of POKEMON?

            -----------------------------------------------
                 -(YES)
              * - With less than fifty:
            Let's see... Uh-oh! You have caught only <##> kinds of POKEMON!
            You need 50 kinds if you want the EXP.ALL.


              * - With fifty or more:
            Great! You have caught <##> kinds of POKEMON! Congratulations!
            Here you go!

              * - If the inventory is full:
            Oh! I see you don't have any room for the EXP.ALL.

              * - If there is room, then he provides Exp.All.
            EXP.ALL gives EXP points to all the POKEMON with you, even if they
            don't fight. It does, however, reduce the amount of EXP for each
            POKEMON. If you don't need it, you should store it via PC.



                 -(NO)
            Oh. I see. When you get 50 kinds, come back for EXP.ALL.

           {A} You impressed me! Here's a hint! Look very closely for gaps
               in the invisible walls!

Trainer 06:{S} Master KOGA comes from a long line of ninjas! What do you
               descend from?
           {C} JUGGLER
           {E} Dropped my balls!
           {A} Where there is light, there is shadow! Light and shadow!
               Which do you choose?

Koga      :{S} Fwahahaha! A mere child like you dares to challenge me?
               Very well, I shall show you true terror as a ninja master!
               You shall feel the despair of poison and sleep techniques!

           {E} Humph! You have proven your worth! Here! Take the SOULBADGE!

               Now that you have the SOULBADGE, the DEFENSE of your POKEMON
               increases! It also lets you SURF outside of battle! Ah! Take this
               too!

                 * - If the inventory is full:
               Make space for this, child!

                 * - If there is room, then he provides TM06.
               TM06 contains TOXIC! It is a secret technique over 400 years old!

           {A} When afflicted by TOXIC, POKEMON suffer more and more as battle
               progresses! It will surely terrorize foes!

[001]     : It's amazing how ninja can terrify even now!

            LEADER: GIOVANNI
            WINNING TRAINERS:
            BLUE

[001]     : Yo! Champ in making! Even I don't know VIRIDIAN LEADER's identity!
            This will be the toughest of all the GYM LEADERs! I heard that the
            trainers here like ground-type POKEMON!

Trainer 01:{S} Your POKEMON will cower at the crack of my whip!
           {C} TAMER
           {E} Yowch! Whiplash!
           {A} Wait! I was just careless!

Trainer 02:{S} Karate is the ultimate form of martial arts!
           {C} BLACKBELT
           {E} Atcho!
           {A} If my POKEMON were as good at Karate as I...

Trainer 03:{S} VIRIDIAN GYM was closed for a long time, but now our LEADER
               is back!
           {C} COOLTRAINER  (Male)
           {E} I was beaten?
           {A} You can go onto POKEMON LEAGUE only by defeating our GYM LEADER!

Trainer 04:{S} Heh! You must be running out of steam by now!
           {C} COOLTRAINER  (Male)
           {E} I ran out of gas!
           {A} You need power to keep up with our GYM LEADER!

Trainer 05:{S} Rrrroar! I'm working myself into a rage!
           {C} BLACKBELT
           {E} Wargh!
           {A} I'm still not worthy!

Trainer 06:{S} POKEMON and I, we make wonderful music together!
           {C} TAMER
           {E} You are in perfect harmony!
           {A} Do you know the identity of our GYM LEADER?

Trainer 07:{S} The truly talented win with style!
           {C} COOLTRAINER  (Male)
           {E} I lost my grip!
           {A} The LEADER will scold me!

Trainer 08:{S} I'm the KARATE KING! Your fate rests with me!
           {C} BLACKBELT
           {E} Ayah!
           {A} POKEMON LEAGUE? You? Don't get cocky!

Giovanni  :{S} Fwahahaha! This is my hideout! I planned to resurrect TEAM ROCKET
               here! But, you have caught me again! So be it! This time, I'm not
               holding back! Once more, you shall face GIOVANNI, the greatest
               trainer!

           {E} Ha! That was a truly intense fight! You have won! As proof,
               here is the EARTHBADGE!

               The EARTHBADGE makes POKEMON of any level obey! It is evidence
               of your mastery as a POKEMON trainer! With it, you can enter the
               POKEMON LEAGUE! It is my gift for your POKEMON LEAGUE challenge!

                 * - If the inventory is full:
               You do not have space for this!

                 * - If there is room, he provides TM27.
               TM27 is FISSURE! It will take out POKEMON with just one hit!
               I made it when I ran the GYM here, too long ago...

           {A} Having lost, I cannot face my underlings! TEAM ROCKET is finished
               forever! I will dedicate my life to the study of POKEMON!

               Let us meet again some day! Farewell!

                 * - He leaves the gym.

[001]     : Blow me away! GIOVANNI was the GYM LEADER here?

[002]     : From here on, you face the ELITE FOUR one by one! If you win,
            a door opens to the next trainer! Good luck!





Lorelei   :{S} Welcome to POKEMON LEAGUE! I am LORELEI of the ELITE FOUR!
               No one can best me when it comes to icy POKEMON! Freezing moves
               are powerful! Your POKEMON will be at my mercy when they are
               frozen solid! Hahaha! Are you ready?

           {E} How dare you!

               You're better than I thought! Go on ahead! You only got a taste
               of POKEMON LEAGUE power!



Bruno     :{S} I am BRUNO of the ELITE FOUR! Through rigorous training, people
               and POKEMON can become stronger! I've weight trained with my
               POKEMON!

               RED! We will grind you down with our superior power! Hoo hah!

           {E} Why? How could I lose?

               My job is done! Go face your next challenge!



Agatha    :{S} I am AGATHA of the ELITE FOUR! OAK's taken a lot of interest in
               you, child! That old duff was once tough and handsome! That was
               decades ago! Now he just wants to fiddle with his POKEDEX!
               He's wrong! POKEMON are for fighting!

               RED! I'll show you how a real trainer fights!

           {E} Oh ho! You're something special, child!

               You win! I see what the old duff sees in you now! I have nothing
               else to say! Run along now, child!



Lance     :{S} Ah! I heard about you RED! I lead the ELITE FOUR! You can call me
               LANCE the dragon trainer! You know that dragons are mythical
               POKEMON! They're hard to catch and raise, but their powers are
               superior! They're virtually indestructible!

               Well, are you ready to lose? Your LEAGUE challenge ends with me,
               RED!

           {E} That's it! I hate to admit it, but you are a POKEMON master!

               I still can't believe my dragons lost to you, RED! You are now
               the POKEMON LEAGUE champion!

               ...Or, you would have been, but you have one more challenge
               ahead. You have to face another trainer! His name is...BLUE!
               He beat the ELITE FOUR before you! He is the real POKEMON LEAGUE
               champion!



Blue      : Hey! I was looking forward to seeing you, RED! My rival should be
            strong to keep me sharp! While working on POKEDEX, I looked all over
            for powerful POKEMON! Not only that, I assembled teams that would
            beat any POKEMON type! And now! I'm the POKEMON LEAGUE champion!

            RED! Do you know what that means? I'll tell you! I am the most
            powerful trainer in the world!

* - Upon defeating Blue:

Blue      : NO! That can't be! You beat my best! After all that work to become
            LEAGUE champ? My reign is over already? It's not fair!

            Why? Why did I lose? I never made any mistakes raising my POKEMON...
            Darn it! You're the new POKEMON LEAGUE champion! AlthougH I don't
            like to admit it.

Oak       : RED!

* - Oak enters the room.

Oak       : So, you won! Congratulations! You're the new POKEMON LEAGE champion!
            You've grown up so much since you first left with <POKEMON>! RED,
            you have come of age!

            BLUE! I'm disappointed! I came when I heard you beat the ELITE FOUR!
            But, when I got here, you had already lost! BLUE! Do you understand
            why you lost? You have forgotten to treat your POKEMON with trust
            and love! Without them, you will never become a champ again!

            RED! You understand that your victory was not just your own doing!
            The bond you share with your POKEMON is marvelous!

            RED! Come with me!

* - He takes Red to the final room, wherein a computer has been placed.

Oak       : Er-hem! Congratulations RED! This floor is the POKEMON HALL OF FAME!

            Their POKEMON are also recorded in the HALL OF FAME!

    Red's name is Yellow; the rival's is Blue.

Blue      : Yo YELLOW! Gramps isn't around! I ran here 'cos he said he had
            a POKEMON for me.

Poke Ball : That's a POKE BALL. There's a POKEMON inside!





   [ Oak Pokemon Research Lab ]
* - When trying to leave town via the grassy path to the north:

Oak       : Hey! Wait! Don't go out!

* - Oak approaches Yellow.

Oak       : That was close! Wild POKEMON live in tall grass!

* - A Pikachu appears, ready to fight. Oak catches it in a Poke Ball.

Oak       : Whew... A POKEMON can appear anytime in tall grass. You need your
            own POKEMON for your protection. I know! Here, come with me!

* - He takes Yellow to his laboratory. They approach a table upon which one
    Poke Ball has been placed, and next to which Blue is present.

Blue      : Gramps! I'm fed up with waiting!

Oak       : Hmm? BLUE? Why are you here already? I said for you to come by
            later... Ah, whatever! Just wait there.

            Look, YELLOW! Do you see that ball on the table? It's called a
            POKE BALL. It holds a POKEMON inside. You may have it! Go on,
            take it!

Blue      : Hey! Gramps! What about me?

Oak       : Be patient, BLUE, I'll give you one later.



* - Before selecting a Pokemon:

Oak       : Go ahead, it's your!

Blue      : Humph! I'll get a better POKEMON than you!

* - Upon attempting to leave:

Oak       : Hey! Don't go away yet!



* - As Yellow approaches the Poke Ball, Blue shoves him aside and takes it.

Blue      : No way! Yellow, I want this POKEMON!

<game>    : BLUE snatched the POKEMON!

Oak       : BLUE! What are you doing?

Blue      : Gramps, I want this one!

Oak       : But, I... Oh, all right then. That POKEMON is yours. I was going to
            give you one anyway... YELLOW, come over here.

            YELLOW, this is the POKEMON I caught earlier. You can have it.
            I caught it in the wild and it's not tame yet.



* - Before leaving:

Oak       : If a wild POKEMON appears, your POKEMON can fight against it!
            Afterward, go on to the next town.

Blue      : Heh, my POKEMON looks a lot stronger.



* - Upon attempting to leave:

Blue      : Wait YELLOW! Let's check out our POKEMON! Come on, I'll take you on!

* - His Pokemon is an Eevee. At the battle's end:

Blue      : WHAT? Unbelievable! I picked the wrong POKEMON! Okay! I'll make my
            POKEMON fight to toughen it up! RED! Gramps! Smell you later!

* - He takes his leave of the laboratory, as well as the town.

    Yellow's Pikachu comes out of its Poke Ball.

Oak       : What? Would you look at that! It's odd, but it appears that your
            PIKACHU dislikes POKE BALLs. You should just keep it with you.
            That should make it happy! You can talk to it and see how it feels
            about you.





     [ Social Script ]
Oak       : You should talk to it and see how it feels.

Mother    : YELLOW, if you drive your POKEMON too hard, they'll dislike you.
            You should take a rest.

            Oh good! You and your POKEMON are looking great! Take care now!
